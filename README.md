To make the visualization interactive, where users can add points (such as the generator point GG and other points) and perform point addition, we can proceed with the following steps:
Plan:

    Allow Input of Points: Users will be able to input or select points, starting with the generator point GG.
    Point Addition: Visualize point addition based on the elliptic curve rule for adding two points PP and QQ on the curve.
    Result Display: After performing the point addition, the resulting point will be shown on the graph.

    The plot will demonstrate point addition on the elliptic curve. The red point is the generator point GG, and the green point is the result of G+GG+G, which is an example of point doubling.

This setup can be further expanded to allow user interaction with point addition, where you can input or select points and visualize their addition in real time.
